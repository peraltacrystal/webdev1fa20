    <h1>Crystal Gives The Internet a 8.5/10 </h1>

<p>I was born in '99 so I don't really remember a time without computers. I mean when I was a kid I was always outside so I didn't care for those things until I was around the age of 11-12. My first impressions of it were amazed and my brothers quickly taught me how to download music illegally (oops) </p>
<p>Personally, the internet has always been there for me. It's helped me find answers for any questions I had. It has led me to many hobbies such as doing my own makeup or nails. The internet has opened my eyes to many different genres of music and interact with those about it.</p>
<p> The internet also keeps me entertained for hours. I find myself getting sucked in the hole of YouTube and when I realize it I am watching a video with a completely different topic than I originally sought out for. Also, I miss when YouTube was pure and not just a bunch of kids trying to get rich off it.</p>
<p>To conclude, the interenet is pretty damn cool. I mean I literally am using it right now to do this assignment. We use the internet to have zoom classes. Without it who knows how this pandemic would've played out. Anyways, I rate it an 8.5/10 because sometimes the internet leads me to using social media and not everything on there is always positive.  </p>
