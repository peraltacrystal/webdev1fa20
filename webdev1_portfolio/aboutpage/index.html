    <h1>About Page...</h1>
    <p>This portfolio contains all of my work thus far in Web Dev 1. I know it is pretty bare and not the most aesthic looking portfolio at the moment, but I plan to make it prettier in my free time. I was mainly concerned about having all the correct content and working links</p>

    <p>I, for the life of me, could not get the home buttons to work so I will need help, for now I'll turn it in :(</p>
